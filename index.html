        <h2>Letra Completa de "TELEKINESIS"</h2>

<p>Used to wanna fuck an R&B bitch, then that shit happened (yeah, yeah)</p>
<p>Used to wanna be rich, then it finally happened</p>
<p>Thought it'd make me happy (thought it'd make me happy)</p>
<p>I could've took the pain and I could've went out sad</p>
<p>Streets stepped in and raised me, but I ain't have my daddy</p>
<p>Niggas tryna clone me, run off with my swag</p>
<p>For sellin' coco, got Chanel on my jacket (jacket)</p>
<p>Shawty give me mop with the less, it don't last (last)</p>
<p>Takin' more drugs all alone in a mansion</p>
<p>Walkin' around tweakin' with the yop in my hands</p>
<p>Just another broke hoe just preachin' for these bands (just another hoe)</p>
<p>And I know I'm due for a billion-dollar advance (uh-huh)</p>
<p>I can see the future, I can see the future (I can see the future)</p>
<p>I can see the future, it's lookin' like we leveled through the sky</p>
<p>I can't wait to live in glory in eternal lastin' life (livin' in glory)</p>
<p>Won't you take the wheel? And I recline and I sit still</p>
<p>Might as well turn up now, He gon' pop up unannounced</p>
<p>To the trumpets, do you like the way it sounds? (Like the way it sound)</p>
<p>You know the future of the bounce, ayy</p>
<p>I can hear your thoughts so loud, I can hear the crowd so loud</p>
<p>Do you like the way it sounds? Ayy</p>
<p>I can hear your thoughts so loud, I can hear the crowd so loud (so loud)</p>
<p>I can see the future</p>
<p>Ride with Wolf and Storm' and some troopers</p>
<p>Ridin' through this shit, this shit is stupid</p>
<p>Sky walkin' 'round like I'm Luke-uh</p>
<p>Duckin' all these convos like I'm Bruce-uh, super</p>
<p>Mobbin' with my angels dodgin' Lucifer (mob)</p>
<p>Seein' every angle, I can see through ya, yeah (yeah)</p>
<p>I can see the future, it's lookin' like we leveled through the sky (see enough)</p>
<p>I can't wait to live in glory in eternal lastin' life (livin' in glory)</p>
<p>Won't you take the wheel? And (seen enough) I recline and I sit still</p>
<p>Might as well turn up now, He gon' pop up unannounced</p>
<p>To the trumpets, do you like the way it sounds?</p>
<p>You know the future of the bounce</p>
<p>Count so much money 'til my skin peel</p>
<p>Cherry-red Benz like the real pimp (yeah)</p>
<p>My bro cook up dope, it take real skill</p>
<p>Share my bitch with my hoe, ain't got no chill (no)</p>
<p>You either gettin' to money or you're gossipin' (yeah)</p>
<p>She chose up, put on this coat, now she lottery</p>
<p>Places I thought I'd never go I found models in</p>
<p>I hear the demons clear when they callin' (yeah)</p>
<p>Flyest on the Earth, so I had to name myself a planet (Pluto)</p>
<p>Automatic dead when you goin' against my family</p>
<p>Few breakups went public, I just bought another baddie (bought another baddie)</p>
<p>Bitch knew I was toxic, when she met me, I was a savage (met me, I was a savage)</p>
<p>High in the hills tryna avoid any madness (yeah)</p>
<p>Private on the Lear, this just like we imagined</p>
<p>Only settlin' for this Hi-Tech 'cause I ain't got the Actavis (yeah)</p>
<p>I'm tryna be modest (yeah), it sound like I'm braggin' (braggin')</p>
<p>Cartier my frames (frames), all because my fame (fame)</p>
<p>Bitch said she ashamed to love me in public, rather go private (seen enough)</p>
<p>Count so much money 'til my skin peel</p>
<p>Cherry-red Benz like the real pimp</p>
<p>My bro cook up dope, it take real skill</p>
<p>Share my bitch with my hoe, ain't got no chill</p>
<p>You either gettin' to money or you're gossipin'</p>
<p>She chose up, put on this coat, now she lottery</p>
<p>I can see the future, it's lookin' like we leveled through the sky</p>
<p>I can't wait to live in glory in eternal lastin' life</p>
<p>Won't you take the wheel? And I recline and I sit still</p>
<p>Might as well turn up now, He gon' pop up unannounced</p>
<p>To the trumpets, do you like the way it sounds?</p>
<p>I can't get enough, told you I just want it all</p>
<p>I can't get enough, you ain't been doin' enough (do you like the way it sounds?)</p>
<p>So cold, so cold</p>
<p>It's so cold, so cold, so cold</p>
<p>You could see the future, there's a sparkle in your eye</p>
<p>Why you all up on my thigh? Can't let you</p>
<p>Niggas plottin' my demise, I got murder on my mind</p>
<p>I got money on the line, I can't lose if I tried</p>
<p>Let no bitch break my stride</p>
<p>Chosen, I'm gon' bet on me</p>
<p>Chosen, all my shit antique</p>
<p>Frozen, I can't feel no heat</p>
<p>Diamonds dancing on me</p>
<p>You startin' afresh, man, you fell out of pocket</p>
<p>You fucked that girl that you met at the party</p>
<p>I got some new niggas down in the lobby</p>
<p>How can I sleep when you're out catchin' bodies?</p>
<p>I still wanna be with you, trust me, I know that's insane</p>
<p>I'd rather fuck on you than fuck on lames</p>
<p>I did some shit in Berlin, I'm OD</p>
<p>We both ain't shit and it's workin' for me</p>
<p>Workin' for me, yeah</p>
<p>I can see the future, I can see the future</p>
